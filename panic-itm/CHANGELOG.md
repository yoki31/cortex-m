## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- switched from `ITM::ptr()` to `ITM::PTR` as `ptr()` has been
  deprecated/removed (#385).

## [v0.4.2] - 2020-11-14

- Support cortex-m v0.7.0

## [v0.4.1] - 2019-04-28

- Updated `cortex-m` version to not have the issue when linking multiple
  versions of it.

## [v0.4.0] - 2018-09-10

- [breaking-change] The `panic_handler` feature gate has been removed. This
  crate will compile on 1.30-beta and on stable 1.30 when they are released.

## [v0.3.0] - 2018-09-03

### Changed

- This crate no longer depends on `arm-none-eabi-gcc`.

- [breaking-change] Move from the `panic_implementation` attribute to the
  `panic_handler` attribute, which will be stabilized.

## [v0.2.0] - 2018-06-04

### Changed

- [breaking-change] moved from the, now removed, `panic_fmt` lang item to the
  `#[panic_implementation]` attribute.

## [v0.1.1] - 2018-05-11

### Changed

- Specify the full behavior of the panic handler in the documentation.

- Remove the unspecified behavior of aborting after printing the message. This lets us drop the
  `core_intrinsics` feature gate.
